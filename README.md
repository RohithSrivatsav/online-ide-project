# Online IDE

**CodeEZ** is an online integrated development environment (IDE) that allows users to write, analyze, and execute code in multiple programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and Ruby. This project is designed to provide real-time analysis of code performance, including complexity analysis, and allows users to interact with a live execution environment.

## Features

- **Multi-language Support:** Write code in Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and Ruby.
- **Real-time Code Execution:** Execute code and view the output instantly.
- **Code Analysis:** Analyze the code for syntax errors, improvements, and performance complexity.
- **Time Complexity Visualization:** Get a real-time graph of the code’s time complexity using a graph chart.
- **Save and View Code Snippets:** Save and view your previous code snippets for quick reference.
- **Interactive UI:** Easy-to-use interface with language selection, code editor, and result output tabs.

## Tech Stack

- **React.js** for building the user interface.
- **Monaco Editor** for the code editor component.
- **API Integrations:**
  - **Judge0 API** for code execution.
  - **Perplexity API** for code analysis and time complexity evaluation.
- **Lucide Icons** for UI icons like Code, Terminal, and Graph.
